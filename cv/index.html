			<p class="font-body">
				A frontend-focused web developer with deep knowledge of JavaScript, CSS, and HTML
				backed by an education background in Design, and Illustration.
			</p>
			<p class="font-body screen-block only">
				I got my first web development role after teaching myself web development on my commute and,
				until now, I haven't lost my love and childish passion for all things internet.
			</p>
			<p class="font-body">
				My desire for perfection drives me to respect the smallest details:
				keeping designs tight, interactions fluid, and code efficient and maintainable.
				<br>
				Then pragmatism, my experience, and research helps aid conversation around budgeting
				time, scope, and the future of the product.
