	<div class="section-about">
		<p class="font-body">
			A frontend-focused web developer with a deep understanding of JavaScript, CSS, and HTML
			backed by a background in design, and illustration.
			I excel in frontend web architecture, componentisation, and design systems
			keeping teams streamlined and focused.
		</p>
		<p class="font-body">
			My desire for perfection drives me to sweat the details:
			keeping designs tight, interactions fluid, and code efficient and maintainable.
			Then my experience, pragmatism, and research allows me to
			budget for time, scope, and the future of the product.
		</p>
		<p class="font-body">
			I got my first web development role after teaching myself web development on my commute and,
			until now, I haven’t lost my passion for all things internet.

		<div class="definitionlist">
			<h3 class="job-company">Travel</h3>
			<p class="font-body">
				A revelation, as before leaving the UK around 5 year ago, I hardly left the house.
				Moving to Singapore has opened my eyes to travelling and I have been trying to get to new
				countries at least every couple of months.
				Activities while abroad include diving, hiking, and just meeting new people.
			</p>

			<h3 class="job-company">Art</h3>
			<p class="font-body">
				I still enjoy life-drawing and try to go to classes to keep my drawing sharp.
				During breaks you could find me sketching or folding a paper animal.
			</p>

			<h3 class="job-company">Computers</h3>
			<p class="font-body">
				Most of my spare time is spent with computers, and electronics:
				learning new things and immersing myself in their world.
			</p>

			<h3 class="job-company last">Gaming</h3>
			<p class="font-body">
				The progressive problem-solving nature of real-time strategy games makes them my ‘go-to’,
				but I also enjoy a few casual action and first-person shooters to relax with.
			</p>

			<h3 class="job-company">Guitar &amp; recording</h3>
			<p class="font-body">
				Having taught myself guitar while at University, I enjoyed recording sessions in my bedroom...
				all parts played by yours-truly.
				However, these days I tend to keep my playing more to myself.
			</p>

			<h3 class="job-company">Photography</h3>
			<p class="font-body">
				I am familiar with modern DSLR cameras, but as I generally take photos while out-and-about
				I stick mostly with point-and-shoot camera and my Phone.
				As I started diving I’m currently enjoying the Olympus TG-5.
