      <h1>Danie,</h1>
      <p>It's been a crazy year, full of highs and lows.</p>
      <p>You've been with me all the time, and I've seen you grow… a lot.</p>
      <p>Some of it has been happy, some sad, some crazy (that's you)… and you stayed with me through it all.</p>
      <p>
        I've seen you learning an instrument.
        <br>I've watched you learn to love yourself.
        <br>I've been with you as you grow stronger.
      </p>
      <p>And although we don't know what the future holds, I hope we always stay close.</p>
      <p>I hope I can always count on you to be… well… you!</p>
      <p>
        I love you Danie,
        <br>Merry Christmas.
