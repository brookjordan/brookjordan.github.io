      <h1>Danie,</h1>
      <p>
        It's been a crazy year, full of highs and lows.
        <br>Some of it has been happy, some sad, some crazy, (that's you!)
      </p>
      <p>
        I've seen you learning an instrument.
        <br>I've watched you learn to love yourself.
        <br>I've been with you as you grow stronger.
      </p>
      <p>And, you stayed with me through it all.</p>
      <p>
        Although we don't know what the future holds, I hope we always stay close.
        <br>I hope you know that I'll always be there for you, as best as I can be.
        <br>And I hope I can always count on you to be… well… you!
      </p>
      <p>
        I love you Danie,
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Merry Christmas
